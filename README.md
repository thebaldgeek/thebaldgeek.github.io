# The main ACARS website

You can search a lot of satcom ACARS feeds (and some HFDL / VHF VDL ones as well) on the site:-    
[tbg1.airframes.io](https://tbg1.airframes.io/)  

## About this website  
This website is just a brain dump and rough help notes to assist others in getting the hardware and software together to receive and decode ACARS messages from the main modes/frequencies.    
Its not perfect, its not finished, its not polished..... in time, these pages will fade as more help docs are written over at airframes.io   
   
# About ACARS    
Please take the time to [read this ACARS description](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/introduction-to-acars/). Its one of the best overviews from signal to data I have ever come across.    


###  READ THIS!

My motto is 'fail fast, fail often'. I am NOT a programer. Do NOT use any of the code shown here. These pages and the code on them are for entertainment purposes only.   
The best way to put this is: `I don't know what I'm doing, but I know that I don't know what I'm doing.`
