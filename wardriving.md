Navigation: [home](README.md)  

Wardriving is about picking up as many Wifi SSID's as possible. Having them accuratly GPS tagged, and striking the ballance between range and accuracy.   
thebaldgeek started around Dec 2015 on Wigle. Before then, he was actively wardriving for about 8 years with many different setups. He's been testing different setups and antennas since thats clearly a strong interest.   
Aug 2024 he got the bug again and started pushing for the 1 million mark (Nov 2024, just about 1/2 million Wifi discovered), here are some notes and curent setup tbg is running.
